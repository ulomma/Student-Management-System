This project began as a command-line application and gradually evolved into a complete full-stack web application. It showcases the progression from object-oriented programming and relational database management to REST API development and a modern React frontend.

The application allows users to manage student records through a responsive React frontend while exposing a fully tested REST API backed by SQLite. It demonstrates how a traditional Python CLI application can evolve into a complete full-stack software project.

# My Deployment

I deployed this Flask backend application to an AWS EC2 Ubuntu server and configured it for continuous operation and secure public access.

## Deployment Stack

- **Backend:** Python / Flask
- **Application Server:** Gunicorn
- **Server:** AWS EC2
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Linux
- **Web Server / Reverse Proxy:** Nginx
- **Firewall:** UFW
- **HTTPS:** SSL/TLS
- **Database:** SQLite

## Deployment Process

1. Cloned the backend repository onto an AWS EC2 server.
2. Set up Python and a virtual environment.
3. Installed the application's dependencies.
4. Configured Gunicorn to serve the Flask application.
5. Created a systemd service to keep the application running continuously.
6. Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy.
7. Configured UFW to control server access.
8. Configured HTTPS using a DuckDNS domain and SSL/TLS.
9. Tested the deployed backend through its public HTTPS endpoint.

## Architecture

Client → HTTPS → Nginx → Gunicorn → Flask → SQLite

## What I Practiced

- AWS EC2 deployment
- Linux server administration
- Python backend deployment
- Flask application deployment
- Gunicorn configuration
- systemd service management
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- UFW firewall configuration
- HTTPS configuration
- Public API testing

## Deployment Outcome

The Flask backend was successfully deployed to AWS EC2 and configured to run continuously behind Nginx with HTTPS enabled.

## Deployment Evidence

The screenshots below document the deployment and server configuration.

### 1. Flask Backend Running with Gunicorn

The Flask backend was configured as a systemd service and verified to be running successfully.

### 2. Nginx Reverse Proxy

Nginx was configured and verified as an active reverse proxy for the Flask backend.

### 3. UFW Firewall Configuration

UFW was configured to allow the required network traffic for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.

### 4. Public HTTPS Deployment

The deployed Flask backend was successfully accessed through its public HTTPS endpoint.

### 5. GitHub Repository

The source code for the deployed backend is maintained in my GitHub repository.
